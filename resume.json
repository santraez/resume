    "summary": "I'm from Ilo, a small port town in southern Perú, and I share my home with my 7 cats. I work as a full-stack web developer, crafting high-performance and efficient custom products. I'm always learning and keeping my skills up to date, exploring new ways to create software. I love coming up with ideas to solve problems and actively sharing my experience.\n I've worked solo, developing web applications from the ground up, and as part of development teams for innovative companies in different industries. When I'm not working, I enjoy creating useful and unique apps that are free for everyone. I'm also a huge animal lover and support efforts to prevent pet abandonment in my community.",
